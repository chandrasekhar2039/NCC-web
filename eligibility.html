              <h4><a href="">Paratrooper Camp</a></h4>
              <p>The physical requirement of this course is running 1 km in 4 minutes, 5–6 pull-ups, 22 push-ups and 36 squats. So it needs very good stamina to be a paratrooper.<span id="dots"></span><span id="more" style="display: none;">The training and selections of the interested candidates start from about 4 months before the camp. And only the luckiest and fortunate person gets to be one of the chosen few. They are interviewed at the unit level, group level and then directorate level to be a part of the Para Basic Course.<br>
                The minimum criteria are as follows (but the required criteria is way-way higher than this):<br>
                 1 km run in 4 mins<br>
                 36 squats<br>
                 32 sit-ups<br>
                 5 pull-ups<br>
                 22 push-ups<br>
                Now, since this is a very prestigious camp, the competition for this is also very high, due to which the standards are also raised higher.
                It now all depends on your directorate to select cadets based on new standards. But when you get into PTS, all the training will seem easier because they’ll follow their set standards and also because NCC cadets will have very less time for this course.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="">RDC</a></h4>
              <p>Selection proceess of RDC is quite tough . And it varies from directorate to directorate or depends on the contingent commander who is leading the RD camp, (a colonel rank).<br><span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2" style="display: none;">1.

(generally it starts in mid September or in start of October.)<br>
                2. All aspiring cadets Report at informed battalion before time.<br>
                3. Before final RDC there are 3 Pre-RD camps or may be more depends on directorate in which cadets are trained in order to compete with other national level cadets .<br>
                4. Selection for 1st preRD camp taken by contingent commander, 1 or 2 trainers from OTA or IMA assist him along with all PI STAFF (other rank personals) .<br>
                5. Almost 250 Passionate cadets gets the OPPORTUNITY for 1st camp from all directorate.<br>
                6. The selection process is purely on DRILL BASIS.<br>
                7. In the 1st camp cadets are given opportunity to show their talent via flag area (painting), culture(dancing,singing& all),selections for YOUTH EXCHANGE. & BEST CADET starts.<br>
                8. Contingent of squad drill & guard of honour are trained.<br>
                9. As soon as the Pre-RDC 1 about to end, cadets are distributed into “A” SQUAD “B” SQUAD, “C” SQUAD. A squad cadets are ready for 2nd Pre-RD camp , B squad are mediocre , C squad are almost out of RDC .<br>
