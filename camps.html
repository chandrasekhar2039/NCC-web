Cadets are also introduced to weapons such as a .22 caliber rifle. They are also given tasks of serving food to fellow cadets.<br>

              <h4><a href="">Basic Leadership Camp</a></h4>
              <p>The Basic Leadership Camp was a 10 day camp. It was a camp focussed towards building up of a cadet’s leadership qualities and soft skills.<br><span id="dots2"></span><span id="more2" style="display: none;">The camp site provided cadets with a hygienic atmosphere and was well equiped for all basic needs. Rooms were allotted, spacious for 5 cadets to fit in one. Initially, while some rooms occupied a mere 3 cadets and some had 7, a few cadets got to shuffle up and get accustomed to other people through the 10 day camp. It proved to be a platform for people from different backgrounds and diversities to mingle together and come to know each other.Different mentalities, different opinions,different thoughts clashed under one roof,teaching us the lesson of understanding; the lesson of respect.Along with teaching inter and intra personal skills,the camp proved to be a forum where the cadet came to know about the Services Selection Board (SSB).The cadets were taught with activities how each round of selection takes place. The potential of each and every cadet was kept a note of. Constant ecouragement followed the partcipation of all.<br>
                 From Group Discussions to Debates, every cadet got a chance to speak their mind.Every cadet got the oppurtunity to face a crowd that was going to listen to them, very carefully.<br>
                  Mornings began with Physical Training exercises. From doing yoga to running around the PT ground, we were happy. It feels good when somebody appreciates you, and appreciation was heard everywhere for everyone which only seemed to boost everybody’s morale and passion towards whatever they did.<br>
                  Classes commenced after breakfast everyday and classes meant fun. Everyday the lecturers would give us
                activities that would excite us and push us that one more step ahead in life. Culturals were held on the last day of the camp bringing in us a sense of finality as the show ended with one brilliant speech after the other from our mentors.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="">Advance Leadership Camp (ALC)</a></h4>
              <p>Six Advance Leadership Camps (ALC), are conducted every year, which a total of 1350 cadets attend to focus on personality development, leadership skills and orientation for induction into the Armed Forces.<span id="dots4"></span><span id="more4" style="display: none;"><br>Advance Leadership Camp is conducted 6 times in various places throughout India. A cadet must have completed Basic Leadership Camp in order to qualify for this camp. In this camp the officers give cadets training for SSB screening and entrance.
                1. SSB GUIDE – This is “the place” specially dedicated to SSB training ,you will get guidance from the screening to a personal interview.<br>
                2. FACULTY – Teachers are none other than the commanding officers ,SSB psychologists,GTO from the armed forces (in our case it was an officer from OTA)<br>
                3. Conducive Environment – the place is buzzing with YEP cadets and probably the best from every directorate people who are seriously into the SSB thing which makes it quite a good learning platform<br>
                4. No Drills – To be spared from hectic drill hours is like a dream come true for any cadet and this happens at the ALC . All you need to do is EAT STUDY SLEEP AND REPEAT<br>
                5. Best Food – don’t get too excited you wont get an IMA lunch but probably better than what you get in CATCs<br>
                6. Mock interview and GD – you will have a face to face personal interview with the CO’s and they will inform you about your Lacuna moreover the frequent GD and lecturette sessions will help you grow further<br>
                All these attributes makes ALC a must go to camp if you wish to prepare yourself for SSB and it is better than going for a paid coaching as you will receive the same thing there as well.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="">Mountaineering Camp</a></h4>
              <p>Adventure is the life blood of youth. Adventure training in the NCC provides knowledge to cadets of the topography as well as experience of different weather conditions and adventurous living under camp conditions.<span id="dots5"></span><span id="more5" style="display: none;"><br>The whole aim is to inculcate a spirit of adventure, explorative inquisitiveness, develop stamina, endurance, discipline, courage, determination, comradeship, leadership leading to development of self-confidence, team spirit and spirit-de- corps amongst NCC cadets. NCC cadets are given the opportunity to participate in a host of adventure activities including Mountain Treks and Expeditions,
                Adventure based activities enable cadets to hone leadership skills and enhance their character qualities. Cadets with potential are given opportunities to participate in expeditions requiring higher degree of expertise and proficiency.<br>
                Mountaineering Expeditions.<br>
                NCC has been conducting two mountaineering expeditions every year, one each for the girl and boy cadets. Since 1970, the NCC has conducted 75 Mountaineering expeditions, of which 40 were for boys and 35 for girls.Mt Rudugaira (5819m), Mt Deo Tibba (6001m), Mt Gangotri I (6672m) and Mt Kamet (7746m) are some of the mountains that have been scaled by NCC cadets. History was created when the first ever Mt Everest Expedition of NCC Cadets (Boys) scaled the world’s highest peak in two batches on 19 and 20 May 2013.<br>
                NCC is training a NCC Girls Expedition to climb Mt Everest (8848m) in 2016.<br>
                Mountaineering Camp is one of the best camp in NCC. It usually takes place in Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports in Manali and Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling. The Camp also carries a bit of risk but its a life time experience. The actual fees is somewhere between 10k to 15k but The Government of India (Ministry of Defence) is paying your fees. So your work is just to attend the camp.

              <h4><a href="">Paratrooper Camp</a></h4>
              <p>Every year 40 boy & 40 girl cadets attend Para Basic Course at Para Training School, Agra for a duration of 24 days.<span id="dots6"></span><span id="more6" style="display: none;"><br>NCC conducts over 1450 camps annually on a regular basis as a part of its training. The camps help the cadets to develop camaraderie, teamwork, leadership qualities, self-confidence, self-reliance and dignity of labour. The Republic Day camp is the acme of NCC training. There are some camps which only the luckiest ones get a chance to attend, like the Para Basic Course in which only 40 boys and 40 girls are selected all over India per course. I was one among those luckiest to have a chance to attend this camp.<br>
                In this course, you are entitled to 3 jumps during the daytime and if time permits, you will do all the 5 jumps (including one night jump and one with equipment). The camp lasts for about a month. The initial days are to train and build stamina and confidence of cadets to make the jumps.
