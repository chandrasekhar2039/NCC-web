                      Myself Rashmi Ranjan Nath, Ex SUO (1 Odisha arty bty). I've attended RDC 2018 and IMA attachment camp 2018.
                      Now I'm going to share the selection process of IMA attachment camp.

                      IMA attachment is one of the prestigious and exciting camps for a NCC cadet.
                      The camp comes once in a year and 2-3 cadets are selected from each directorate.
                      To give equal opportunity from the whole directorate this comes in a rotation basis to every group of the directorate.
                      Then, 2-3 cadets are selected from each battalion of the group and are called for the interview to the grp HQ by grp commanding officer.
                      The cadet needs to prepare well for the interview. He should prepare speaking about himself, family members, NCC, armed forces, country, military aptitude, general knowledge etc thoroughly.
                      The interview process is decided by the officer. Sometimes cadets have to pass a preliminary test to attend the final interview.
                      In the preliminary stage he may be given a topic to write or may be asked about a certain topic(here general knowledge and current affairs will play a major role).
                      Then the selected cadets of preliminary stage will undergo a personal interview. He will be asked about various topics which are mentioned above. *Some other things need to be kept in mind that asking the officer before entering, go by marching and tham and lastly exit with wishing jaihind or good day very politely.

                      Now wait for the final result which will be informed by the unit to the cadet and experience this beautiful camp to the fullest&rdquo;</p><span class="quote-arrow"></span></div>

                  <div><p>&ldquo;NIC, National Integration Camp is a camp of advanture and fun. It's a beautiful trip or  journey of your life in which you will experience the best moments of your life. You will meet new friends, with whom you will make memories for life  and the same people will become your family. You will meet new people from every region of india.
                    Now, let me tell u how I got selected for this camp.
                    For this camp, you must have communication skills. Not only proficiency in language but also by emotion and behaviour.
                    You must know some extra curricular activities like singing, dancing, acting, motivating, playing guitar, tabla, drum etc or any other musical instrument.
                    In addition to that, you have to attend a ATC camp in which you will know the basic knowledge about a NCC camp and you will know the value of unity. This unity will help you greatly in NIC camp as at NIC camp you have to represent your state with unity.
                    You have to perform all functions and competitions standing as a unit.
                    For this camp you have to know everything about your state like history, geography, culture, language etc. as there you have to represent your culture and you will know about other state culture also.

                    This will give you so much excitement and joyful experiences. To be true, I did so many mistakes also but don't worry, sometimes this mistakes are real fun and become somehow memorable. And these mistakes only will show you the right path for your next step. So, enjoy every moment and make it memorable. Make more friends, gain more knowledge and that too without any regret. All the best for your next NIC camp&rdquo;</p><span class="quote-arrow"></span></div>

                <div><p>&ldquo;By the time you're reading this, you must be knowing about most of the perks of National Cadet Corps. Another such opportunity NCC provides to its cadet is Inter Directorate Shooting Championship, also known as IDSC. The motive of IDSC is to select a shooting team for NCC INDIA to take part in National Rifle Association of Indian (NRAI) events like All India GV Mavlankar Shooting Championship Competition and National Shooting Championship Competition every year.
                  IDSC is a national camp where 16 cadets i.e. eight boys and eight girls from every directorate come together to compete with each other. The selection for IDSC starts at the unit level. Two cadets, the best shooters of each unit are sent to IUC(Inter unit competition) where the group team of the same 16 cadets consisting of eight boys and eight girls is selected based on their performance. Then all groups compete on an intra-directorate camp also known as Inter group competition and then the final team is selected for practice shooting capsules. The selected team is trained for about a month or two(depending upon the Directorate). They then undergo various sorts of training for this camp because one isn't allowed to make mistakes in the firing range even in their wildest dream. The conduct in firing ground is completely different than on the field.
                  Coming to the weapons used in IDSC. There are three weapons used that is 0.22mm Sporting Rifle, 0.22mm Peep sight German Rifle, and 0.22mm Air Rifle. Cadets are allotted the category of shooting depending on their expertise. There are two categories in each weapon - Prone position and 3P(that is all 3 positions i.e. prone, kneeling, and standing).
                  Various cadets who represented our country in shooting via NCC, Anjali Bhagwat is a great example of it.

                <div><p>&ldquo;NCC provides us with many opportunities in adventure sports, one of them being Mountaineering. The completion of Basic Mountaineering courses can help cadets get the job of their dreams and find their hidden talents
                  My journey started when I was asked to create a medical certificate as per the instructions stated in the allotted University. After this, I was told to head on to their allotted institute, which is one of the five above mentioned institutes. A PI staff was appointed to guide us, the selected cadets, to our allotted institutes and also to accompany us back to our own Colleges.
After arriving at the Institute, I had to complete all the documentation for my allotment of vacancies. I was then allotted a room and made to form ropes (groups) with around 6-7 people in each rope.
Every course had around 80-120 people including cadets, civilians and defence personnel. I got the chance to interact with people from Sri Lanka, Australia, Dubai, etc. This was a great opportunity to be able to interact with people and uphold my national integrity. The other cadets also got a chance to interact and stay with defence service personnel which provided them a greater insight to the real defence life.
Let me mention the best day of the mountaineering training. It was the time during celebration of Diwali. I celebrated it with my fellow cadets on an altitude of 12,500 feet in my base camp. Getting to celebrate Diwali with my new found friends was extraordinary.
I got to witness a beautiful snowfall and the sentry duty I had to serve at the time of heavy snowfall. In that, I had to stay up for 2-3 hours at night during heavy snowfall and clear the snow from the top of the tents so that they don’t get covered from the snow. The sentry duty was very essential and everyone had to do it sincerely even if they did not want to. And this is because the lives of my ropemates, roommates and tentmates depend upon me. And any kind of negligence could result in their deaths. I was given a small bag to carry my personal belongings and food items with me while travelling up on to high altitudes.
This entire experience has definitely helped me become a better person. I learnt leadership qualities since every day a new leader was chosen from each rope(group) to lead. This enhanced my leadership quality and gave me confidence.
